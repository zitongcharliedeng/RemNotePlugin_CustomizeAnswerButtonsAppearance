- [x] Customize color of each answer button w/ color picker
- [x] Option to hide all text and emojis individually on each button (i.e. just red and green)
- [x] Option for custom sound effects for each answer button press
- [ ] Allow the above sound effects to work offline, without popup workaround
- ~~[ ] Option to show the keyboard shortcut currently bound for an answer button~~
- [ ] Create cool presets, and custom profiles to easily switch to-and-from (with shortcuts mayhaps)

> **Note:** For the sound effect workaround, if you enter the queue from the homepage, the popup should appear automatically, otherwise you can manually trigger the popup with the command (CTRL+K) => "Show the popup for enabling answer button sound effects."
